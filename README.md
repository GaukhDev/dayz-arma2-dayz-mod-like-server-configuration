This contains modified files of what the Gaukh's ArmA 2 DayZ Mod-like server used.
If you want to achieve similar results, you might need to take a look into these.
It does only contain config files and/or modified files needed for the same experience.
You need to download the mission and mods yourself or just use regular Chernarus Plus.

I recommend using these on a fresh server. I am not accountable for you destroying DayZ server by recklessly copy-pasting these. Please take a look at these and decide what you want or what differs and merge files accordingly.

The server's types need to be updated every version. For this CustomCE folder is used. I've categorized them nicely for easier management.

Configure gamelabs.cfg's server ID and API Key in profiles folder, if you are using CFTools gamelabs
